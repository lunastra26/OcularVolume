# CNN based Detection of Globes for Volume Quantification in CT Orbits images

## Description
A Convolutional Neural Network is presented here for predicting globe contours in CT images of the orbits.
The following are available in the repository
1) A pretrained CNN model for predicting globe masks in axial CT images of the orbits
2) An evaluation script for testing new CT images
3) Utilities script
