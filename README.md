## CNN based Detection of Globes for Volume Quantification in CT Orbits images

### Introduction
Fast and accurate quantification of globe volumes in the event of an ocular trauma can provide clinicians with valuable diagnostic information. A Convolutional Neural Network is presented here for predicting globe contours in CT images of the orbits and their subsequent volume quantification.

### Description
The following are available in the repository
1) A pretrained CNN model for predicting globe masks in axial CT images of the orbits
2) An evaluation script for testing new CT images
3) Utilities script
